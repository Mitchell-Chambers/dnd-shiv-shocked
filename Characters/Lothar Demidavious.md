<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='1478-08-24' data-title="Birth of Lothar">As the second son of a noble royal adjacent family, Lothar knew he was destined for greatness.</span>


Raku has looked into the flames of destiny and seen past the hearth of your life.  
You must choose how brightly you will burn.


On the high moon, a stormy night, the boat keeled, and the group that hardly knew each other tipped into the Ocean.

> *"He is a man without honour, but he wants to believe he isn't."*

If you have faith in the kings of new, knowing Lothar will disabuse you of that notion.

Second son in a family with a prodigy next in line, there was not much for Lothar to make of himself, nobody saw him as a spare, they saw him more like a chair, there but gladly traded for a throne.

The fail-son of another fail-son, perpetually kept afloat through the safety net afforded to the forebearers of the Empire.

Lothar has no divine right, for that would imply he was chosen.
He has no skill, for that would imply he is driven.
He has no arcana in his blood, for that would imply his ancestors were anything other than lucky.

Lothar is a child with unearned strength and charm, obtained through breeding and position.

>*Lothar Demidavicius, what do the Fates have in store for you?*

Lothar - Modernisation of the Germanic name Clothar, meaning ‘Famous Warrior’


### Faulty Noble in a Square Hole
Lothar was not made in a vacuum, Raku saw the Jenevieve and her crew, cresting then crashing into the shores of the New World, and planted a fool with claws of steel well in advance to protect their emissary.

Lothar should become the heart, the anchor of the party. No act is too great, no deed too difficult. He may be a ponce, a lordling, an elitist. But he truly believes in the glory he could earn if he just does the right thing.

## Statistics
Logline: Human Fighter 3
Lothar has only three aspects of note to his character-

His above average physical stats (STR:13, DEX:13, CON:12)

His privileged charm and appearance (CHA: 16)

His birth (not exactly a number you can roll)

At first glance a reasonable player would see these attributes and pick one of the following classes; Bard, Paladin, Skald, Sorcerer, Bloodrager. Swashbuckler.

Lothar is not controlled by a reasonable player.
