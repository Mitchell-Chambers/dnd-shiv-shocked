<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='1478-08-24' data-title="Birth of Lothar">As the second son of a noble royal adjacent family, Lothar knew he was destined for greatness.</span>


Raku has looked into the flames of destiny and seen past the hearth of your life.  
You must choose how brightly you will burn.


On the high moon, a stormy night, the boat keeled, and the group that hardly knew each other tipped into the Ocean.

> *"He is a man without honour, but he wants to believe he isn't."*

If you have faith in the kings of new, knowing Lothar will disabuse you of that notion.

Second son in a family with a prodigy next in line, there was not much for Lothar to make of himself, nobody saw him as a spare, they saw him more like a chair, there but gladly traded for a throne.

The fail-son of another fail-son, perpetually kept afloat through the safety net afforded to the forebearers of the Empire.

Lothar has no divine right, for that would imply he was chosen.
He has no skill, for that would imply he is driven.
He has no arcana in his blood, for that would imply his ancestors were anything other than lucky.

Lothar is a child with unearned strength and charm, obtained through breeding and position.

>*Lothar Demidavicius, what do the Fates have in store for you?*

Lothar - Modernisation of the Germanic name Clothar, meaning ‘Famous Warrior’


### Faulty Noble in a Square Hole
Lothar was not made in a vacuum, Raku saw the Jenevieve and her crew, cresting then crashing into the shores of the New World, and planted a fool with claws of steel well in advance to protect their emissary.

Lothar should become the heart, the anchor of the party. No act is too great, no deed too difficult. He may be a ponce, a lordling, an elitist. But he truly believes in the glory he could earn if he just does the right thing.

## Statistics
Logline: Human Fighter 3
Lothar has only three aspects of note to his character-

His above average physical stats (STR:13, DEX:13, CON:12)

His privileged charm and appearance (CHA: 16)

His birth (not exactly a number you can roll)

At first glance a reasonable player would see these attributes and pick one of the following classes; Bard, Paladin, Skald, Sorcerer, Bloodrager. Swashbuckler.

Lothar is not controlled by a reasonable player.


## Build Choices
### Fighter
Bravery – Will saves, useful if uh, half the party didn’t have Will as their main save.

Armour Training - High AC, high options.

Weapon Training – High attack/damage, high options

Advanced Armour/Weapon Training – The GOLDEN option for the fighter, never lose this.


## Notes
#### Earned Names  
Barkeater
Second Son
Shiv Fool

#### Relationships  
Gelic, the Gnome Charmer - Protective, Paternal.
Summer, the Fledging Wizard
Ihe, the Elven Trickster
Urist, the Minister of the Flame


Feats
Steadfast Personality
You rely on your assuredness and sense of self to help keep your mind clear.
Benefit: Add your Charisma modifier instead of your Wisdom bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. If you have a Wisdom penalty, you must apply both your Wisdom penalty and your Charisma modifier.

Persuasive
You are skilled at swaying attitudes and intimidating others into your way of thinking.
Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.


Bloodline – Imperious  
Bloodline – Martyred  
Bloodline – Destined  
Bloodline – Phoenix  
Bloodline – Vestige  
Bloodline – Abyssal  
Bloodline – Infernal



# Advancements

## Burgeoning Leader - Level 4

You managed to escape the deadly isle intact! You gain +4 on Survival checks.

>*Where once you felt as if rulership was a birthright, the hardship of your doomed voyage has left you with a careful confidence and inner strength that you used to lack. You find yourself exuding authority, convincing your peers more easily and make a habit of giving useful advice.*

You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomancy checks made to influence creatures. This bonus increases to +4 if the creature has at least 5 Hit Dice more than you, and goes to +6 if the creature consideres you their liege. You gain Combat Advice as a bonus feat.

Once per day you can give an Inspiring Speech (take at minimum one full round action) which grants all allies within 60ft a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to your character level.

Once per day you can designate a physical seat as a **Throne**, a symbol of your authority that when seated in it you are continously granted the effect of the Heroism spell.
