**Aura** strong [divination](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Divination); **CL** 15th; **Slot** head; **Price** 5,000 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

DESCRIPTION
This conical iron jingasa, or war hat, grants the wearer a +1 deflection bonus to AC. When struck by a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) or [sneak attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack), the wearer can spend an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (similar to the [fortification](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-armor#TOC-Fortification) armor special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage is instead rolled normally.

This ability functions only once, though the jingasa continues to grant its deflection bonus even after the other ability is expended.
