A _holy_ weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities%20#TOC-Damage-Reduction). It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of evil [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment). It bestows one permanent [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities%20#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities%20#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This [negative level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities%20#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) cannot be overcome in any way (including by [restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration) spells) while the weapon is wielded.
