Nockmar Family are not actually ruling in name, the guilds do in the town.

Dragon Slayers Guild (Adventurer's Guild) due to historical issues.

Building is fairly run down and it's clear they are coming undone with their glory days behind them. It's made out of simple pine wood and remains a single story.

Military is also offering work for the Empire, as a result of trying to keep the peace. Operating out of the fort, they handle the Bounty work.

Fort Destiny, (Manifest the destiny of the east coast)


## Dragon Slayers Guild
Kingsley Benton the Third, of the Dragon Slayers Guild is quite welcoming

The party applies and isn't required to pay any fees and dues, but must undertake a test of courage.

Challenge the greatest member from our Hall of Combat or Stopping a Dark Menace plaguing the northern roads

## Fort Destiny II
The party then heads straight to Fort Destiny to see if they can get rewarded twice for the simple job of clearing the northern roads.

Interesting: Across the wide street, coming off the streets, you have this impressive, wide, imperial fortress, and across the road, this shitty little keep.

Demidavicious - Family seat
We are required and held tightly by the feudal contract between our family the lordships and the peasantry.

Nockmar - Completely absent of responsibilty for their region, and have been saplanted by the Empire.
Keep of Nockmar/Blacktower/Leech of Old Harbour is adjacent to the Fortress Destiny

Captain of the Guard Zavala - Sentinel Shield
The Gatehouse (The Helm)

The party are let into the Courtyard and are greeted by Officer Cayde and Lieutent Six

It is a bit more lethal than expected, as it is praying on larger groups and even an entire village has been taken apart.
Corpses are sizzled and rend from the bone.

The Reward for Proof of Preventation and Extermination - 
The creature leaves corpses in those conditions, fur, claws, large unblinking eye. Hideous cry. Only attacks at night.
15,000gp Gold Reward.
Company of soldiers were sent off and never returned.

The pattern of attacks tells the tale of a creature on a migratory path, dipping into the road and then retreating into a forest

There are height markings, showing that the creature is avoiding heights and slopes on it's journey, and is most likely to cross an eastern path.

2 Heavy Combat Trained Horses,
1 Pony
1 Large Wagon

Horse Names:
Frank II
Frank III
Bait

We travel north and find the roads well undertravelled for the region, with lush greenery and fields, but nay a traveller in sight. The party turns east, and races their wagon to intercept the expected path of the 'Road Terror'

Weather changes, and the rain begins to fall.

Water elementals can be seen in the fields around, playing in the shower and beginning to unnerve the horses.
They buck and Ihe is forced to cast Calm Animal to stop Frank II from bolting away.

Ahead of us is two overturned carts, ascending from them are several armed individuals.

Claud Windward approaches, and introduces himself as an Emperor's man leading the Emperor's men. He attempts to dissuade the party from advancing further, citing the bad vibes and preyed upon roads.
He collects an extortion from the party, 4 gold a person.
However, with the need to advance further to face the ill force for their quest, the party attempts to negociate past them, and when the price is spiked to 50gp, Urist asks if we could kill them and Ihe immediately starts casting a spell.

Lothar dubs his new steed Chlothar, the party insists it's name is Flight Stallion

>GM: It turns it's head in an unnatural way, spying the Wizard that tripped it, and barrels down upon you Summer.
>Summer: Like attack it? I have flank.
