The party attempts to pursue the Umbral Owlbear
Lothar gets tired but the coffee and healing hand of Urist keeps him afloat.

The party comes across a dead herdbeast that the owlbeast killed with a swipe in it's rush to escape

Splitting up into two groups, Lothar and Urist continue to hunt the beast via traditional means and tracking. Summer and Ihe will attempt to intercept it at the swamp which the party deduces must be it's intended location.

# Swamp
Dragon Teraxis was slain many years ago here. Bones were so tough that they could not be cut or degraded, leaving the massive skeleton. Creating this magnificent sight.



# Encounter with the Knight
Roland and his squire 


# Urist in Bluebuckle
Deeply Nivera worshipping town, named after the blue slanted roofs and blue towers.
Urist however is set upon by brutes and is forced to fend them off.
