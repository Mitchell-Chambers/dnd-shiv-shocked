The drums of war can be heard even in the house.

Ihe agrees to help even at cost to the group.

Basil agrees the forced march is the next best move, even if it's two days in row.

Tansy approaches Winfred and they agree it's in mutual interest for the advanced march.

Urist gives a speech.


Ihe and Winfred break off to track down the stray halfling while Urist holds down the fort.

The Humans, deep in the mire of fear and sufferers of the first causalities in the day before turn to their faith and their priest and demand the burning of a Halfling in the fires of their god as a sacrifice for the road ahead.
