[[2022-10-30 - 009 - On Treatises, Devils and Snakes#Summary]]

We are in the square in the ruined campsite - C17
Heading north from C17

We start seeing things out of the corners of our eyes, a cold sweat begins to overtake us.

# C18 - Raid Boss AWOL
Square room, Low walls, tall columns, sealed doorway to the north.
Lever turns via Urist and the door opens
We see another Sarcophagus, however opened and pentagram damaged.

Andrew rolls Perception to see the Devil in the room, seeing only bare stone- which is not the norm for these [[Sealing rooms]].
The room has been stripped of supplies.
Three kinds of evil outsider- Devil, Demons, Daemons

We seal the room, and feel as through we have not accomplised shit.

# C19 - 
East of C17 - intricate open air space with four distinct arches, with an alter before all other three.
This reminds Urist of token places of respect to deities. Unclear who this space is devoted to.
Andrew Knowledge Religion (14) ?Draconic and Elvish, can see Draconic ruins carved in the east alter, and runes that invoke Elven history carved into the North altar. 

Urist approaches the Draconic Altar. The Amulet he holds warms and reacts to the space, the center gemstone glows and then goes quiet just as quickly.

Lothar is reminded by the GM that he is still deaf after making a great joke.
>Ihe: So we can all talk in other languages about Lothar?
>Lothar: Yeah, but do you have rich parents?

Urist: OH [[Ydersius]], DRACONIC, he is the dragon god that has been fucking with us.
Summer offers a token of blood using the Throat Punch Dagger, along with the Amulet to the Dragon Altar. 

The ground begins to shake all we all feel a surge of energy.
The party gains 5 temporary HP each, and the two mages restores a spell slot of the highest level, as they receive the blessing and thanks of [[Ydersius]].

Summer considers the cost of exploiting a god's blessing and spamming the temporary hitpoints.

Ihe ponders the third altar, made with giant hands, but can't seem to crack the nature of the altar.
Ihe Linguistics (19) - Refers to a great creature of two heads, the rare lanaguage casts back to Ihe's homeland, to the culture of Ogres.

The Elven altar is similar to the current language, but it is mostly sentence fragments, like the different in Old English and Modern English

No-one can remember when we got the amulet, or even where we got it, only thinking that it was a long time ago with cannibals and misc loot.

# C20 - Ydersius' Pavilion
South of C17
A pavalion area, reminding us of the open space on the opposite side of the complex
Raised columns
Reliefs painted with mythologic scenes faded with thousand years age
Snake statues, 4 in number, 2 on each side.
Coral structures
Stairs leading to the garden and pool C3

Summer begins smashing the statues of [[Ydersius]] for their ruby eyes, spliting them with Urist, 4 each.

Entrance to the east left.

# C21 - 
Curious structure
Very tall, nearly reaches the top of the curtain
Open air, with a pit in the center, very bare.
Pipe entrance near the bottom, sized like a head.
Several runes carved on the side, designed to heat the water.
>Brad: Fucking Osen looking-arse

You can see a small chamber leading to the north.
Ihe Trap Check (29)
Blue dial around the edge of the frame, narrow holes hide near the top, likely to spawn arrows if the mechanism is trapped.

Summer throwing an item with mage hand reveals a pressure trap. Ihe identifies the poison darts that should trigger it are missing.

# C22 - 
Smaller chamber
Cracked monolith - scenes from important historical battle. Rows and Rows of the Serpent creatures wielding shields and scimitars.
They appear to be battling other snakes, the heroic snakes wielding red and gold, and the foes are holding dark and blue. Clearly a Civil War.

Shelves around the sides have a treatise, freshly read, not dusty, freshly consulted. [[Treatise on Dark Portals]]

# C16 - Not Hagia Sophia
Largest in the entire complex. Tall arch supports. Reminding us of a cathedral, due to it's architecture and concave to direct sound back down into the space. It is so sound and hymms travel.

However this place has not seen use in a long time. No Pews, altars or statues, only a pile of bones across the hall. Terminating at the statue of [[Ydersius]], tall as several men, undamaged.
50ft wide, 200ft deep.

Ihe Heal Check (5) - Examining the bones, they are in fact bones. Not animal, but the bone structure of the snake people mixed with bones of all manner of bipedal creatures. Cannot identify any anthropological details about them.

The statue is made of the same yellowed stone as the rest of the structure. It may once have been painted or any other variety of colours, decay having taken it to it's edge.

Ihe discovers under the crook of [[Ydersius]]'s leg, a hidden buttom. When pressed the ground rumbles and the tiles move. Revealing a hidden stairway under the statue, leading to C23

# C23 - Waterfall Entrance to 
As we walk down the stairs, we hear running water, and can see thin sheets of water running down either end of the room. Terminating at the far end, which also has a rushing and deep sheet of water running down it. A pool, 15ft ahead, occupies the flow, and must have a drainage system.

Ihe - the first thing I notice is someone has already been here, noticing the clear tracks made on the steps. Clawed feet. Something was placed at each corner, rods have been position beneath the fall. Each is atopped with a small emerald.

Urist - Emeralds are green magic.

Summer - They must be aligned, geometry is important to magic, a change to the spell must be done simulatiously.

>Arguing about a lack of Detect Magic
>Brad: I also have Create Water, which uh...
>Gestures to the waterfall room around him
>Brad: Not exactly needed.

Ihe sticks her head through the water to peek at any traps after a path is opened at the far side after messing with the emerald rods.
Ihe feels something clearly magical, based on how she feels the back of her neck clearly tingling.
An axe trap has been triggered already (like the Blood Chamber)

The cooridor is longer than render distance, so we are unable to determine the otherside.

The party flows the path, and it carries us along for five minutes, deep underground. Ihe feels nervous, Urist feels great.

At the end of the cooridor there is a large stone doorway. On which a stange curved line is drawn on the left doorway- an Arcane Mark.

Lothar Strength (=19) stains a hammy trying to push the door.
Urist turns the handle, but can't get the door to give.

Uniform green frescos trace the walls, with haunting visages of snakes leering at us from the dark.

Ihe identifies the prsence of blood on the door, and Summer reopens the old cut to apply the Arcane Mark to the door in hopes that is the key.
The door reacts with the stroke. But doesn't crack the portal. Despite messing around with the structure of the rune we cannot break it.

Ihe realises that its the constellation that needs to be marked from the Treatise of Dark Portals. Tracing the head of the Serpent constellation the door swings wide and lets the party in.

# C24
Again another open chamber,
four pedastals, four pillars almost. Two on each side of the room. A featureless tiled wall on each side.
The party begins placing gems, rubies and gold into the obolisks, sudden a bolt of light begins connecting the pillars together, each connected to the other three.
Suddenly a creature appears, five snake heads and 10ft wide, not yet threatening to attack us. It hisses in a langauge that we don't understand. 
Summer attempts to fake an hissing Open Seasame, apparently offending the creature, it strikes forward and begins to attack the party.

# Hydra Hungers
The five heads attack forward, one strikes at Summer, as she cowers behind a pillar. 12 does not beat 11+2 for cover.
Summer performs a Knowledge Arcana check and learns two things.
1. It is a Hydra, and will die when it's body gives out or all the heads are severed.
2. It has a special vemon and the ability to lunge.
3. It has no vulnerabilities, but the regen abilities are hindered by fire and acid.

Summer retreats and casts Spontanous Immolation.
Hydra rolls a 12 against the Spell DC. And receives 12 fire damage and is now on fire, dealing damage on Summer's turn.

Head 2 attacks Lothar, hitting on a 19 and dealing 7 points of damage as it knashes on his arm. Fortunately he rolls a 19 Fortitude save against the vemon that attempts to bleed him.

Lothar cuts off a head, and Ihe plunges her rapier through another's eye socket.

# C25

While we were engaged in the fight, the wall behind the hydra has opened up and the party proceeds down it.

At the end is a circular chamber that is open and features a raised throne, sitting an ancient sketelon, serpent kind through and through, likely died on it's throne.
Various effects are around us, remincinant of personal items.
Stone tablets.

Serpentine carvins on the walls, of a snake moving forward yet growing in size. The center of the chamber has a statue of a fanged women, bat wings, snake tail for legs. Almost looks like it is weeping blood. Must be a trick of the light coming out of the walls.

There is a crown on an stone table, forged out of gold, with a large black, swirling opal, a fist sized saphire, sharpend to a point like a dagger. Polished stone, in an oval shape, like an egg
Jeweled goblet, carved out of a skull, preserved by magic. With a Saphire carved into the side.

Lothar sudden regains the sense of hearing he once had. The party has a sensation of a wet rope entwining around our bodies, invisible and soft.
Suddenly an internal monologue begins to permate through the entire parties mind.

"Greetings" - It speaks
"Sup" - Summer
Glowing etheral mist appears in the center of the room. It turns to us, a wisp of the past.
"You are broken and sore and tired, please sit and rest a while." - The peaceful voice
"My name is Mortimer, I used to rule here, I have been dead for 10,000 years."
This isle used to be the location of my stronghold, my kin and I spent our days exploring the higher mysteries, unfortunately part of our protection involved trapping spirits on this island, and so no soul that enters this place may leave.
At our time this was a kindness, as the dead did not ascend to the high places for the gods had not yet seized the outer realms, but instead to the low places, the fire and the cold sleep."
I promise you I have no reason to lie, as you cannot leave. the Waters of this isle are protected by an elder spirit, a water elemental that is hateful and unable to let stranges leave. So their souls remain, trapped here."
"a Crusade, I would call it an urpising, as rulers of this land, upour creatures were our slaves, bred for it. Dwarves for the stone and the mines. Humans for the fields and bred like rabbits. Elves as our finders, our hunters, our woodsmen."
"At that time we were too arogant, and did not account for uour rising power and the great rebelion, and so uour gods cursed us."
"Waht do you know of us? Nothing. We were once mighty, and are now cursed to walk on two legs, clubbed feets, overly muscled hands, lack of intellect that we once had."
Yarzoth led you to this iland, as an excuse to reach here. She did so she could use Sacrifices. Depends on their potential, she needs good material, ghoul sacrifices, Iena. The First True Serpent born in 10000 years, and the first to realise what she lost."
"She is not traveling through the portal, she is using it to resurrect me, and with those trades, life for life, she will breath me back into these planes.
Your gods are bored and they left. So for now we shall replace your leaders slowly, and I shall gore on the flesh of your children and fruits of your labors. She shall bring me back and together we will return here and destroy you.
As your people sailed west, ignorant of your history, you activated our old protections that is how my spirit is here.

My people knew this day would come, we hid our elders and our most powerful in temples like this, and primitives that you are, you have not found all of them and will reach 10000 years of patience upon your people. It is for the best mice, you were bred to serve do not let the oxen guide the cart, you let it pull it. Under our vision you could have a hgher purpose greater direction. How can you not understand it? This, to obey me should be natural. Do you not feel a space in our heart that our voice fills.
Heed this warning as my resurrection is at hand. We have never formed bonds like yours. Weakness is a habit to be killed out. Yazoth has already done that to her two compariots.

No legs, that is the sign of a true born.
Fear my resurrection.
The Wisp disappears.

Main Questline Unlocked

As we leave the bay of the sand dragon, the sky has opened into a Maelstorm. Two figures, far into the distance take flight from 



The party wakes to, in Old Harbor, if only they were that lucky.
