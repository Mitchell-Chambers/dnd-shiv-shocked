Summoned around the party are swirls of blue magic, and we disappear from the Island.

As a result of the teleport, Summer lands the party onto the side of a mountain. Emerging onto a slope surrounded by mist.

# Old Harbour.
Several rich merchants call this town home, and it is one of the largest ports in the Imperial Conclave.

Knockmar family has owned the land of the port for a long time, their sigl is a lion rampant, or a lion reposed, depending on the context.
Compared to Demidavicious their power is strictly cautious and untested, as the significant wealth of the city does not compare to the land and loyalty of the Demidavicious Guard.

A variety of trades bustle through the city, sailors primarily often identifiable by their stronger accent and obvious lingo, but also farmers, weavers, carvers.

The party stops on the way down to pick some herbs, aware of the oncoming threat of large ants.

Gelik informs the party of the process involved to make potions from various ingredients. Moondew and Magnesium.

Regular cost of a healing potion is 50gp.

The party finds a minecraft and abandoned track.

Ihe takes Urists tower shield as a boogieboard and Lothar pushes the party down the track. Lothar unfortunately does not make the necessary acrobatics check to climb in and the party shoots off down the hill.

The track comes to a sudden end and the cart shoots upwards, catching air for 5m and then crashes back to earth.

Many items have been broken and smashed with the result of the crash, and the two victims of the crash, Urist and Gelik, stop to make camp in the immediate vicinity of the crashsite, both on a single hit point.
