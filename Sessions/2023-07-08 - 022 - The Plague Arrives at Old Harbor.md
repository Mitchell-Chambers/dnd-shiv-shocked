# Ihe's Interrogation
Ihe is introduced to the Brigadeer General, wearing a white cloak and black armour.

He explains that people are suffering all over the Empire, suffering and faltering tributary payments means more direct approaches.
1. Do you know about the Plague, Ihe?
	1. No.
2. These are the regional documents that concern you. I pulled them up as I was researching the records of all elven officers in the area. When  you were recruited for the expeditary force, you left this section blank, our recruiters do that. Why did you join the expedition to the new world?
	1. I know it's uncommon, but I went to make sure the nature was under the right care.
3. And so you went on the ship Jenevere and sailed away? You sail away and never arrived?
	1. We did not.
4. And then a few weeks later, you just show up, no CO, just back here, having left months ago. And immediately take on high profile work. What happened?
	1. We were shipwrecked, and it took a long time for my party to find a way out, using the teleport scroll that was provided to the expedition. 
5. It can carry five, who were they?
	1. Why are you interested?
	2. Just answer the question?
	3. Urist. Lothar. Summer. And the last name, I do not recall.
	4. Well maybe time will improve your memory. Was it captain Kovac?

No.

Why not, as superior officer, he would be the first choice.

He was sacrificed. Sacrificed by someone else in the crew .

So a mutiny?

No, mind control .

Mind-controlled, your superior officer? by who, another crew member?

Who? Why?

I do not recall 

Could you speak to the ship wreck?

I don't remember her name, but she had nefarious intentions?

That's it?

Walk me through the timeline here. How many survided the shipwreck?

7 as far as I am aware? 8 I think.

To be clear, there was no mutiny, just one woman mind controlling your captain.

She actually controlled several members of the ship.

I think I can figure out what happened.

You recovered the teleport scroll and there was a discussion about who got to go back to the mainland and things got out of control and heated. And so Kovac never made it back, neither did Rodrick the first mate, did they pull rank to return to safety? Is that not why you changed from 7 to 8 in your story.

No.

I understand your reluctance. We could not reach out for testimony

That's because they died.

Even to divine reach out. Who ever was responsible of their deaths did a great job, better than we believe you to possess. So who was responsible 

The curse on the island that was trying to get outside 

Convenient

Not for us, and your suspicions

Maybe I am wrong.

Maybe.

Gelik! Gelik was the one that I forgot.


I'm glad you are willing to share, have you ever been a guest of the military before?
You are detained until I feel you have satifisifed all my questions, you have no legal recourse. If I feel you are obstructing my investigation I will use my right to hang you dead.
But you told the truth right?

(Check by General)

So you went out on the expedition to ensure nature was not harmed. Did you succeed. You came back and didn't really inform anyone of the results, despite the consequences.

House Demidavious

Funny they have stopped responding to messages and paying taxes, pretty convenient then.

A coincidence I am sure. 


Arrive in town, and set about work for the empire?
Commander Cayde says you went right back into the service- I don't see how eliminating the scourge on local caravans fits with your defense of the earth?

I bonded with my party members, and we decided it was for the best- my five party members.

Urist we have, these other two cannot be found?

Yes, Summer is missing, Lothar is dead.

Funny, we couldn't contact his spirit, so another soul to be mind controlled?

We lost him to the ogre's in Bluebuckle.

You are helping the military to help your comrades, so why are they helping the government?

I cannot speak for them 

Despite your closeness? Funny relationship.


Calls for a grey woman, with a holy symbol of Raku. She chants and cool tingling flows over Ihe. She casts Zone of Truth.


Was your intent with this bounty to make a name for yourself and attain knighthood in the dragonslayers guild?

Not my personal intention.

But it was the group intention? And it was a part of their entrance challenge, to prove their worth?

But you personally could have taken or left the knighthood.

Yes.

Still, you did fufill the bounty didn't you?

We have a head of a creature we believe might be the creature?

If you wanted to, you could join them? I followed a silmilar path, at Ogden's Rest. Ever been there?

Never.

I slaid a [[remorhaz]] and they ordained me on the spot. I left and never went back.

Miss it?

(Ihe checks and he is seething)

Every day. I miss it every day.

Isn't it interesting that you don't take an responsiblity for any choices and decisuion you are making? I find most people, certain people have a weight with their poisition, demands that they must meet. But let's move on.

How much do you know about the situation in town?

Not at all, besides the plague?

The women produces a vial, and he asks Ihe to imbibe it.

Why do I need to drink it?

It will help me understand the truth, drink it or be compelled.

(Craft Alchemy or Spellcraft - 13 - No idea what it is)

Pick up the vial and smell it. smells like strong liquor if you hated alcohol. Ihe starts to drink it. It tastes like rotten swamp water on fire.

(Fort save - 12, fail and 1d4 int damage, mind fire means -2 penalty to will saves.)

No long possible to mask your emotions after consumption.

What do you know about the plague?

Nothing, as far as I am aware.

Are you aware Elves are not effected by the plague.

I was not aware about it. I just got back to town.

Are you aware you are the only elven officer to arrive in this town recently?

No.

What do you know about the current isolation of the Elven Quarter?

Most elves want to steer clear of the rest of the population.

After a mistreatment of the large majority of the dwarves and the racism of the humans they felt best to steer clear.

So why do you feel this way?

Although I have experienced racism and do not revile the other races, I am willing to interact and help the other races.

Would help extend beyond the law?

I helped others... by spreading a plague that kept them apart and kept them from mistreating each other.

No. Spreading plague is not helping anyone.

How large would you say the feeling is with the elven community about this treatment, is it growing resentment?

No, I do not tend to interact with the elves.

Was that intentional?

No, just the course of my travels, I don't tend to cross paths with elves, especially not recently.

Do you know what happened to Ogden's Rest, my home town?

No.

I left young, I wanted to be a knight more than anything. Made a name for myself on Expeditions like you went on. No idea at the time that the local elven population had long felt mistreated and when my father, Lord Marlowe executed an elven poacher on his lands it all came to a head.

One day they woke and found all the elves were gone, confusion, celebration, some were disappointed and some were happy, livelihoods ruined perhaps for the best.
Then they started dying. A person here, a person there.
A target attack from an external threat maybe?
Some people fled, others stayed, like my family.

Nobody realized the water was poisoned, and it spread to the snow. And so everyone died, those that fled, those that stayed. Everyone under a 10ft snowfall. 

We don't know what happened to Ogden's Rest, but I do know who was responsible and my powers led me to learn from the dead that a lone elf had destroyed my entire home. A single insurgent, took all my friends and family, everyone I ever knew.

They called this lone wolf, an elvish name, the shadow of the glen. I believe the name was Col. Do you know a Col?

Do you know any Col?

No

Do you know any insurgents?

No

Do you harbor any anti-empire sentiments?

No.

Ihe can't help but feel quite feverish- delirium beginning to kick in.

Do you know why I joined the Iron Brigade? Because you aren't half as clever as you think you are. Your goal has been to become and knight and infiltrate the empire from inside.
Now help me and tell me if you are the big fish I am looking for, or how I can find the big fish.

How can you know something that isn't true.

So you haven't been involved with any magic plagues or elves with animosity to the empire?

Words catch in Ihe's throat.

Something got your tongue?

There was a plague that was created by a cult, just outside Bluebuckle. 

Why reveal this information  late into the questioning, seems convenient, what were they doing?

We were hindering some of the cult activities, pretending to be members of the cult.

Seems you've found the edges of our spell quite well. I will give you tonight to rest, but consider if you value your life, find information that will lead me to Col.

He then locks the cage several times over.

# Urist's Interrogation

Urist awakes to find himself out of his armour, and within a windowless room.

I am Magnus Marlowe, BRIG GEN of the Iron Brigade.
We had it well in hand, I took like seven hits from the fooker before it went down so you must have come in clean up duty.
Glad I could have helped.

Routine Questions 
I know how military questioning works.

So when joining, you told the recruiter it was part of your job descriuption to join?
Well house demidavious' twelve son lothar, well priests are tasked with ebign their aides, and he was a rowdy youht , needed a bit of guidance. On the way to the new world, to put hair on his balls, I was asked to keep an eye on him and be his guidance and his conscious.

So lothar wanted to do it?
Well that was more his father, it was either that or the Cloth and humans can't fuck if they do that.

Insert weird aside about dwarf mating cycles- copy Vulcan Mating Wikipedia page for dwarves.

So his father sent him away, I had a similar experience with a sibling of mine.

Was he a fuckwit? He needed guidance and I was supposed to keep him  safe.

Supposed to?

We came back, went to Bluebuckle, I got captured, and uh, he didn't make it.

Summer too?

No we lost her a bit later, lost in the underdark tm (actually the darklands).

Can you tell me what happened to the Jen?

Shipwreck, there was a strom of somekind, and a magical malaise took over. A magic spell had taken over the crew. Some where sick, others were attacked, the others- Kovac was under control, Rodrick wasn't, he helped us wash ashore. He went back and the elf reported that he didn't make it back.

The elf has been good to us, with nature, finding bark for Lothar to eat.

>There bones will be magnificent foundations for our empire.

Did ihe often go off alone?

Aye, when you look at our group, me in full plate stumbling through, Lothar- clumsy, and summer a coward. It made sense for the Elf to go alone, they have a bond with nature.

Kovac?

I don't remember anything, we must have come across him. But I cannot recall his fate.

Or the lady that laid the expedition low?

Nay, nor her name. We saw many people on the Shiv.

[[Smuggler's Shiv]] I have not heard that name before.

That or Flamingo eating the bread.

Ahena, that was her name, the gal that cast the spells. Anyway we crashed, and tried to survive and had many adventures, in our attempts to leave the island. 

Taking Gelik into custody in Arcadia as this conversation is happeneing. 

Check the journal of Kovac, it is in my bag of holding.

You understand you have a duty of care towards the populace, to people?
So there was no dispute with Kovac over the teleportation scroll.

None, he was dead before we found the scroll.

Call in the sister of Nivara. Who then casts a zone of truth over Urist.

SO there was no mutiny?

Where would you say mutiny, why would we come back here if we participated in a mutiny.

(Saying bad things about Elves boosts the self in his esteem.)

Are you aware of the elf taking any protracted long term periods of separation since the band took on the bounty.

I believe to go shopping, and there was that stint about dying.

Then came back.

Got resurrected. Seen her eye, that's how her eye got all fucked up. We offered to fix it, but nah I looked cool in it she said.

One more question Urist. The most important question of all. Do you have any knowledge of, and particiated in with the Plague effecting Old Harbor?

There's a plague effecting Old Harbor?!

We may speak again.

You can't possibly think the elf is on this. Why are you stopping me. I KNOW MY RIGHTS AS A SOVERIGN CITIZ-

# Winfred 

The people at the gate is unsettled by his presence. Several figures take note.

The caravan of refugees heads further south along the Old Harbour wall, but each gate denies access.
