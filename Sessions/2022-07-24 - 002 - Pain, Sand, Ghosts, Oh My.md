Rodrick left us ashore overnight and then he went back for the others. We collapsed on the shore shortly afterwards, leading to session start.

We awake on the shore; sore, sick, and under the pinching assault of beach scorpions. Almost all the party received the poison from the sting of the critters (Investigate Later)  
We found ourselves in a deep bay, abreast a dense jungle.

East/West of the bay stretch and form a rock closed cove, the water is rough and cuts deep into the rocks that form the mouth. A wrecked ship bares trapped out far along the bays teeth.

>Summer: *“We are not on the mainland, rather an island off the coast of the mainland, a place called Smugglers Shiv. Supposedly haunted, a cause of many crashes, and a neighbouring empire tried to erect a lighthouse here. Additionally there exist the risk of other shipwreckees from boats before.”*

Ihe attempts to swim out to the wreck of the Jenieve. The Jenieve will never sail again, a sharp ridge has kept it’s stern above water, wedged between the cliffs and rocks. It will not be long before it sinks. Ihe finds and rescues Lothar’s armour from the crew’s quarter and several papers from the captain’s room.

The party begins looting the shore and making shelter.

Once regrouped, a tropical storm washes over the island (late morning day 1)
