**Cooking**: Allie

The party cross the bay and descends into the sinkhole after a long and lengthy debate about NNW and NNE.

The blood leaks out the door and spills on the ground. Dark chamber inside, covered in bones.

The room is circular, not a great hall, seems to a small circular chamber with runes and transcriptions. No seaweed is present, almost untouched by the water, perhaps by magic. Concentrated in the center, as though they were blasted apart. Walls are carved with 100s to 1000s of runes. A Fanged Cobra motif is there, the Symbol of Urdicis.

Read magic doesn’t work in the space.

The language of the wall is deciphered by Summer, aided by her past studies, remaindered of Draconic and Infernal, the language of the Ancients. A stone carving people, untrusting of paper or tapestries for their works due to their fragility.

The space was built over the temple of another individual, one called the ‘Beheaded One’. The complex was done with the power of slaves. This has several artifacts of importance.

A map is provided to another location, Seventh-Yhi. Other works are in the space, The Treatise on Energies, Dark Portal Treatise, and the History of the Scorpids Treatise. All other works have been destroyed without discrimination. Various pieces of furniture (wood) are relatively untouched.

Ihe hears a rattling sound coming from the courtyard. Suspects it to be a skeleton. Heading east she gets caught out by a snake headed snake man in a courtyard and the party rushed to her aid.
