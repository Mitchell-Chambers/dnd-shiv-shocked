>[!faq] What caused these barbs?

The party comes across the battlefield of an expedition into the darklands, all are dead and covered in barbs. A writ was uncovered.

>[!cite] A Writ on the Battlefield
>15,000 gp to secure a site of mana conduits and setup a teleportation circle for the Empire

Mana is an old and outdated term, and conduit is used to transfer power back and forth.

The corpses are already looted.

We hear sounds coming from a door.

Drawing the Sword of Dawn Winfred cuts another hole in the Darklands and they chase after the concept of the Ogre.

West Kingdom, East Kingdom

Grew in size and strength over time, resulting in many great and terrible wars between them- taking place in the midlands "Midgard"

Midgard is full of peope who went through extremely traumatic events, organising all the disparate groups in a Empire inder a great sorcerer. 

He formed strong Sorcerer cores and arcane academies to protect the people within. Hiding his people within them under conquests. Turning a once barren land into a triving utopia heartland. He then turns around and conquers the East Kingdom, leaving the West as 'The Kingdom'

Midgard has places like Arcadia (Summer's homeland) with Minas Tirith style cities. Our game takes place in the East, with the cultural and politcial overlaps. Hence social infrastructure and yet still robust fedual lords and obligations.

The West has gunpower and weaponry to match The Empire's deep reliance on Magical structures and development with Mages.
Midgard is pure miliutarty dictatorship while the former east retains it's former structures under occupation.

Everything east of the Kingdom has been conquered, driving the colonisalisation effort because a war would deeply ruin both states.

Dwarven homeland is a range that runs near Midgard. Easily repelled the old militaries but the Dwarven Citadels could not oppose the power of a mage bypassing their natural defences and turning them against them.

The Emperor probably shattered and leveled a mountain to prove a point to the Dwarven
