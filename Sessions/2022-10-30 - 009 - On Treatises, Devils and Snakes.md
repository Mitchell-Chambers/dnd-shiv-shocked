**Cooking**: Marko - Soft Tacos

Snake men have ragged clothes, but not old, clearly an oxymoron.

Coins, two sides, one side presents a grove of trees, the other an inscription.Â  They appear to be arcane magic, the disks give off necromancy and divination auras.

Mural of a Fox and a Swan

Fox represent Raku, the Swan represent Nivara, the god of water

### C1 - Scriptorum
That's where we left Gelic and the Girl

>Urist (Brad): *"The fact that the sky is red, I feel like we are on a deadline here."*
>GM (Andrew): *"Noooooooo..."*

### C12 - The Tall West Building 
When lit it reveals a large snake with the head of a humanoid large snake, further investigation mid fight reveals it is a necromantic construct.

Wizard Workshop, common sights, pot with boiled liquid, ginger petals, lilyroots, you can see all kinds of roots, stems, animal tails, fragments of bark, stuff you recognise from a monitor lizard and other common island sights. A Chupacabra snout is also present.

In the middle of the floor, there is a large circle for casting.

Magic Circle: +5 for dice results on Divination spells and Spellcraft for creation while channelling in the circle.

Potion: of remove paralysis

Copper Disk: Inscription - The Eyes of Olbol, a set of copper coins, when placed over the eyes of the dead, the attuned creature can see a vision of the past life and their final moments, at risk of feeling the backlash and pain from their passing, damaging the soul and mind of the attuned.

Wall sconces with plenty of candles, providing insight that the entire city was likely built to survive the submerging of their home.

### C13 - The North Building, Tomb

Inscription on the slab, reading that the building is a tomb.

Urist opens wide. The room contains a similar setup, with a pentagram of salt, however it is now around a coffin of steel. The walls contain no imagery bar that of a Serpent Skull.

It talks about the creature within. "It was a devil named Osgorth, it was tall with a bronze complexion and abnormal limbs, armour possession a coin pattern, and covered in mismatched jewellery and bracelets, very gaudy. The creature 'Devil' wears an uncomfortable smile. His Crypt was built to honour his contribution to the great temple. Everything about him was disproportioned in the drawings, making their depictions very uncomfortable.

**THE PARTY ASSEMBLES TO AMBUSH OSGORTH, DEVIL OF WEALTH**

>Summer (Marko): **After a successful knowledge check** *"Fuck me dead, this is starting to sound like a raid boss."*

Devil of Wealth, takes the tools of its foes and turns it against them, using mind effects and trickery to mess with them?

Lothar takes his cold iron sword and whiffs with it multiple times, not realising that the cold iron sword isn't effective against Devils.

### C14 - Monastery Fruit Clearing, Pillared Tower with Collapsed Walls

>Brad: *"You do have a lovely house, I'm sorry for discussing ceiling height."*

The ceiling is yellowed, and the walls are fit to collapse, with vines and creepers growing deep into the - Green Blushed Skin and Purple Top Fruit. Enough to fill a vial, any creature that consumes the fruit must dance after a fort saving throw. When dancing effecting ends, you persist with a weakness for the fruit for the rest of day. It does count as a single ration.

### C15 - Exit North

>Urist (Brad): **Gestures at the [[magic axe]]** *"If you simply consult the treatise."*

A long corridor with ending with a large bronze door. Part way down a glaive is planted into the wall, next to a pyre. The glaive appears to be magical, Urist can't help but notice that it has a vibe aligned with Raku.

### C16 - The Not Hagia Sophia

Visible from the many clearings around.

### C17 - The Abandoned Camp

10ft hallway with carved tiles, leads to a clearing with an abandoned campsite, ruins around three tents that have been flattened and much discarded cloth. Torn backpack, mouldy parchment. Someone must have been here within the year.
