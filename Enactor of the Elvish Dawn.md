Class Archetype - Investigator

An inspired blade is both a force of personality and a sage of swordplay dedicated to the perfection of combat with the rapier. They use the science and geometry with swordplay to beautiful and deadly effect.
Although some investigators use their honed senses and cunning insight for personal gain, no one excels at such endeavors like the mastermind. Typically, these investigators dwell at the centers of complex networks of lies, minions, or simply precious information, from which they dispense commands, threats, and rumors, all carefully crafted to increase the power of their peculiar empires. While masterminds often act as the heads of illicit organizations like criminal families, thieves’ guilds, or corruption-riddled bureaucracies, they aren’t always evil.
Cryptid scholars research monsters that lurk secretly at the edge of civilization, developing a deep expertise regarding their anatomy, habits, and ecology. Although competent as lone monster hunters, cryptid scholars excel when they have associates with whom to share their insights.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Investigators are proficient with [simple weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#weapons-simple), plus the [hand crossbow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/crossbow-hand), [rapier](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/rapier), [sap](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/sap), [shortbow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/shortbow), [short sword](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/shortsword), and [sword cane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/swordcane). They are proficient in light armors, but not shields.

## Sun's Chosen Weapon
At 5th level, an Enactor gains the benefits of Weapon Finesse with the Sword of Dawn and can treat any Sword of Dawn as an Elven Curve Blade.

## Sunlight (Ex)
Each day an Enactor gains a number of Sunlight points equal to their [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier (minimum 1) plus their [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier (minimum 1).

They regain one Sunlight from scoring a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits) with an Elven weapon.

## Moonlight (Ex)
An enactor is beyond knowledgeable and skilled—they also possesses keen powers of observation and deduction that far surpass the abilities of others. An enactor typically uses these powers to aid in their schemes, but can also use these flashes of inspiration in other situations.

An enactor has the ability to augment skill checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The investigator has an Moonlight pool equal to 1/2 his enactor level + his [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier (minimum 1). An investigator’s moonlight refreshes each day, typically after he gets a restful night’s sleep. As a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions), he can expend one use of moonlight from his pool to add 1d6 to the result of that check, including any on which he takes 10 or 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. An investigator can only use moonlight once per check or roll. The investigator can use moonlight on any [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge),  [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy) and [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate)skill checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he’s trained in the skill.

Moonlight can also be used on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and saving throws, at the cost of expending two uses of moonlight each time from the enactor’s pool. In the case of saving throws, using moonlight is an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions) rather than a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions).

>[!bug] To keep things clean, we can move the attack and saving throw component of Moonlight to Sunlight, and allow the transfer of two moonlight to one sunlight.

## Alchemy (Su)

Investigators are highly trained in the creation of mundane alchemical substances and magical potion-like extracts.

When using [Craft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft) (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an investigator gains a [competence bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Competence-Bonus) equal to his class level on the skill check. In addition, an investigator can use [Craft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft) (alchemy) to identify [potions](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions) as if using [detect magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic). He must hold the [potion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions) for 1 round to attempt such a check.

Like an [alchemist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist), an investigator prepares his spells by mixing ingredients and a tiny fraction of his own magical power into a number of extracts, and then effectively casts the spell by drinking the extract. These extracts have powerful effects, but they are also bound to their creator. Extracts behave like spells in [potion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions) form, and as such their effects can be dispelled by [dispel magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic) and similar effects, using the investigator’s level as the [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level).

An investigator can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts per day is given on **Table: Investigator**. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score, in the same way a [wizard](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard) receives bonus spells per day.

When an investigator mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical aura. An extract immediately become inert if it leaves the investigator’s possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping—an investigator cannot normally pass out his extracts for allies to use. An extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its magic, so an investigator must reprepare his extracts every day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work.

Creating extracts consumes raw material, but the cost of those materials is insignificant—comparable to the valueless material [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components) of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly material component, that component is expended during the consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made from spells that have focus requirements; extracts that duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement.

An investigator uses the [alchemist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist) **[formulae list](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/formulae-lists-alchemist)** to determine the extracts he can know. An investigator can prepare an extract of any formulae he knows. To learn or use an extract, an investigator must have at least an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score equal to 10 + the extract’s level. The saving throw DC for an investigator’s extract is equal to 10 + the extract’s level + the investigator’s [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier.

An investigator may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer to this book whenever he prepares an extract. At 1st level, an investigator starts with two 1st-level formulae of his choice, plus a number of additional formulae equal to his [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier. At each new investigator level, he gains one new formula for any level that he can create. An investigator can also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time requirements. A formula book costs as much as a [spellbook](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/books-paper-writing-supplies#TOC-Spellbook). An investigator can study a wizard’s spellbook to learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula book. An investigator can also learn formulae from another investigator’s or an alchemist’s formula book (and vice versa). An investigator does not need to decipher arcane writing before copying that formulae.
## Investigator Talent (Ex) or (Su)

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an enactor gains an investigator talent. Except where otherwise noted, each investigator talent can only be selected once. The enactor cannot choose investigator talents that add effects to studied combat or studied strike.

- A complete listing of investigator talents can be found here: [Investigator Talents](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator/investigator-talents#TABLE-Investigator-Talents)

## Keen Recollection
At 3rd level, an enactor can attempt all [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill checks untrained.
## A Quiet Word (Ex)

A enactor’s reputation precedes him. At 1st level, once per day a enactor can spend 10 minutes preparing an ally to make a single [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy) or [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate) check (enactor’s choice when preparing the ally) within the next 24-hour period at the enactor’s behest. This skill check uses the enactor’s skill ranks instead of the ally’s. The enactor’s affected ally still uses its own ability bonus for the check.

Furthermore, when a enactor uses this ability, he can expend one use of [[Enactor of the Elvish Dawn#Moonlight (Ex)|Moonlight]] to give the ally use of the [[Enactor of the Elvish Dawn#Moonlight (Ex)|Moonlight]] die when making the check.

At 3rd level, a mastermind can use this ability an additional time each day, and the number of times he can use this ability per day increases by 1 for every third level thereafter. Multiple uses of this ability on the same ally grant that ally the benefit on additional [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy) or [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate) checks.

At 12th level, a mastermind can use this ability to bestow on his ally the use of his skill ranks, similar to the 1st-level effects of this ability but with a wider range of skills to choose from. The mastermind can only bestow this for a skill check that he can use [inspiration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator#TOC-Inspiration-Ex-) on without expending uses of [inspiration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator#TOC-Inspiration-Ex-). For instance, a mastermind with the underworld inspiration talent can bolster his ally’s [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Disable Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device), [Disguise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise), or [Sleight of Hand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand) skill checks, selecting a single skill for each use of the ability.

This ability replaces [trapfinding](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Trapfinding) and [trap sense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Trap-Sense-Ex-).

## Mastermind Defense (Ex)

At 4th level, a mastermind can, as an [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions), expend two uses of inspiration to make an inspired defense. He rolls his [inspiration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator#TOC-Inspiration-Ex-) die and applies the result as a penalty on an [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) made against him. If the mastermind has the combat inspiration talent, he can expend one use of [inspiration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator#TOC-Inspiration-Ex-) instead of two.

## Impregnable Mind (Su)

At 9th level, a mastermind’s secrecy, obscurity, and mental conditioning reach superhuman levels. He becomes immune to any divination spell, [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-), or effect that allows a saving throw (though he can still allow a [divination](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/divination) effect to affect him if he wishes). Even divination effects that do not allow a saving throw have difficulty piercing a mastermind’s barriers, as a mastermind can now choose to think in any language he speaks. Unless the opponent reading a mastermind’s thoughts speaks all of the mastermind’s languages, attempts at thought reading automatically fail.

This ability replaces the [investigator talent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator#TOC-Investigator-Talent-Ex-or-Su-) gained at 9th level.

## Intuitive People Reader (Ex)

At 2nd level, a enactor adds his [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) modifier on [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill checks in addition to his [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier when attempting skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of humanoids. 

At 5th level, an enactor can take 10 on such checks, even when [threatened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares) or distracted.

## Opportune Advice (Ex)

At 4th level, when the cryptid scholar succeeds at a [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) check to identify a monster’s special powers or [vulnerabilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Vulnerabilities-Ex-or-Su-), he can take a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) to share his insights with his allies. Allies within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar gain a +1 [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) to their ACs and on saving throws against extraordinary, [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-), and [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) used by creatures of the same type and all the same subtypes as the monster identified. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cryptid scholar’s [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier (minimum 1) or until he uses knowledgeable strike (see below), whichever comes first. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 [investigator](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator) levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). A creature cannot benefit from opportune advice regarding more than one specific kind of monster at a time.

Once the cryptid scholar has used this ability to provide a bonus against a specific kind of monster, he can’t grant a bonus against that same kind of monster again for 24 hours, unless he expends one use of inspiration when taking a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) to use this ability.


## Knowledgeable Strike (Ex)

At 4th level, the cryptid scholar can direct allies to exploit a monster’s weaknesses. If the cryptid scholar ends his opportune advice early as a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions), each ally within 30 feet who can hear the cryptid scholar deals additional damage on its next successful unarmed, [natural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus), or weapon attack against that specific kind of monster within 1 round. The additional damage is 1d6 at 4th level and increases by 1d6 for every 4 [investigator](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator) levels thereafter (to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level). The damage of knowledgeable strike is precision damage and is not multiplied on a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits); creatures that are immune to [sneak attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack) are also immune to knowledgeable strike. Ranged attacks gain this additional damage only against a target within 30 feet. The ally must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Knowledgeable strike cannot be used against a creature with [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment).

This ability replaces studied strike.
