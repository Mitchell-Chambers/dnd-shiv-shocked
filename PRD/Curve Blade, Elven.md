>_Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare._

You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade due to its flexible metal.

You can use the [Weapon Finesse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-finesse-combat) feat to apply your [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) modifier instead of your [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier to attack rolls with an elven curve blade sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon.
