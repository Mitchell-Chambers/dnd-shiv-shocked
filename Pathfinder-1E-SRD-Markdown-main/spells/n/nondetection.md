### Description

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as *clairaudience/clairvoyance*, *locate object*, and *detect* spells. *Nondetection* also prevents location by such magic items as *crystal balls*. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast *nondetection*. If you cast *nondetection* on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.  
  
If cast on a creature, *nondetection* wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
