### Description

This spell functions similarly to *lesser geas*, except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.  
  
If the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas/quest* for 24 hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the *geas/quest*.  
  
A *remove curse* spell ends a *geas/quest* spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. *Break enchantment* does not end a *geas/quest*, but *limited wish*, *miracle*, and *wish* do.  
  
Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as *geas*, while clerics call the same spell *quest*.
